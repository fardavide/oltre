# Session roles

Three kinds of session work on Oltre. They are not interchangeable, and each one's limits come
from something real rather than from policy.

| Session | May work on | May not |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud** — Claude Code on the web | infrastructure, `core` / domain logic, build and CI, docs, planning and decision sheets | **anything a player sees.** No Compose, no `presentation` module, no screenshot baselines, no design-system components |
| **Local** — Claude Code on Davide's machine | everything, UI included | ship UI with no design behind it |
| **Claude Design** | screen and component design, decision sheets with a visual half | write code |

## Why the cloud session cannot touch UI

Two hard facts, not preferences:

1. **A cloud session cannot build anything that needs AGP.** The remote environment's egress
   policy answers 403 to `dl.google.com`, and every route to the Android Gradle Plugin ends there
   — `maven.google.com` redirects to it, the Gradle Plugin Portal redirects to Maven Central, and
   Google does not publish AGP to Maven Central (see `status.md`). Every `client/*` module applies
   AGP, so UI written there is unverified by definition.
2. **A cloud session cannot reach Claude Design.** `DesignSync` needs an interactive
   `/design-login`, which needs a terminal. So the design it would be implementing is not
   readable from inside the session.

Compose it cannot compile, screenshots it cannot record, against a design it cannot see. Domain
code has none of those problems: `core` is pure, its tests are the specification, and CI is the
gate.

### The one exception: a platform entry point is not UI

`MainActivity` was written by a cloud session at 0.2.0, with Davide's call, and it contains a
Compose call — `setContent { App() }`. The line the rule draws is between **making a visual
decision** and **hosting one that already exists**: an entry point attaches a save directory, goes
edge to edge and hands the platform the `App()` the design already settled. There is no design to
read, nothing to record a baseline of, and CI's Build job compiles the APK on every pull request,
so it is not unverified in the way a Compose screen would be.

This does not widen anything. A screen, a component, a baseline or a `presentation` module is
still off limits to a cloud session, and the reasons in this section are unchanged. And note what
the exception could not cover: **nobody has run the Android build on a device**, which is a local
session's job — see the last two entries under *Pending* in `status.md`.

### It *can* build and run `:core` and `:sim` — use it

"A cloud session cannot build" was the flat claim here until 0.1.1, and it is too strong. `:sim`
depends only on `:core` and consumes its **JVM** target; AGP is in `:core` only to publish an
Android target the sim never looks at. Restricted to those two modules with the Android target
dropped, Gradle resolves everything it needs from Maven Central and the real harness runs
unmodified:

```
.claude/tools/gradle-without-agp.sh :sim:run
.claude/tools/gradle-without-agp.sh :core:jvmTest :sim:test
```

The script swaps in a minimal overlay for the three build files, runs Gradle, and always restores
the real ones — it refuses to start if they have uncommitted changes, because the restore is a
hard `git checkout --`. Nothing it writes is ever committed.

This is what round 7 of the balance log was measured with, and the 0.0.12 greedy week reproduced
byte for byte through it. **So a cloud session doing balance or domain work should run the tests
and the sim rather than reasoning about the numbers** — rounds 2 and 3 wrote their tables by hand
against this same blockage, and hand arithmetic is not a measurement. It changes nothing about
UI: `client/*` still cannot be compiled, and screenshot baselines still go through the manual
Record job.

## Hand-offs are prompts, in a code block

- **Cloud needs Local** → the cloud session's final output is a prompt for the local session, in
  a code block, ready to paste. A cloud session **ends** with that prompt.
- **Local needs Design** → the local session emits a prompt for Claude Design, in a code block,
  ready to paste. It does **not** end there — it waits for the design to come back, then
  continues with it.

Note the asymmetry: cloud→local is a hand-off, local→design is a **round trip**.

A hand-off prompt names: the branch to work on, the docs to read first, what is in scope, what is
explicitly out of scope, and what "done" means. Never a summary of the work — a specification of
it. The prompt-writing rule from the Notion page applies: *a spec plus context, not a leash.*
