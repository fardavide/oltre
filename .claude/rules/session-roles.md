# Session roles

Three kinds of session work on Oltre. They are not interchangeable, and each one's limits come
from something real rather than from policy.

| Session | May work on | May not |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud** — Claude Code on the web | infrastructure, `core` / domain logic, build and CI, docs, planning and decision sheets | **anything a player sees.** No Compose, no `presentation` module, no screenshot baselines, no design-system components |
| **Local** — Claude Code on Davide's machine | everything, UI included | ship UI with no design behind it |
| **Claude Design** | screen and component design, decision sheets with a visual half | write code |

## Why the cloud session cannot touch UI

Two hard facts, not preferences:

1. **A cloud session cannot build.** The remote environment's egress policy blocks
   `dl.google.com`, so Gradle never resolves AGP and `./gradlew build` fails before compiling
   anything (see `status.md`). UI written there is unverified by definition.
2. **A cloud session cannot reach Claude Design.** `DesignSync` needs an interactive
   `/design-login`, which needs a terminal. So the design it would be implementing is not
   readable from inside the session.

Compose it cannot compile, screenshots it cannot record, against a design it cannot see. Domain
code has none of those problems: `core` is pure, its tests are the specification, and CI is the
gate.

## Hand-offs are prompts, in a code block

- **Cloud needs Local** → the cloud session's final output is a prompt for the local session, in
  a code block, ready to paste. A cloud session **ends** with that prompt.
- **Local needs Design** → the local session emits a prompt for Claude Design, in a code block,
  ready to paste. It does **not** end there — it waits for the design to come back, then
  continues with it.

Note the asymmetry: cloud→local is a hand-off, local→design is a **round trip**.

A hand-off prompt names: the branch to work on, the docs to read first, what is in scope, what is
explicitly out of scope, and what "done" means. Never a summary of the work — a specification of
it. The prompt-writing rule from the Notion page applies: *a spec plus context, not a leash.*
